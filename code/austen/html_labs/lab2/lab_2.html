                    <h3>Black and white Photography</h3>
                    <p>This list wouldn’t be complete without mentioning the group of individuals who thought it was unacceptable for Polaroid to stop making instant film. Instead, they bought the production equipment from Polaroid, and within two years, concocted their own formulation, thus making the impossible, possible. In the words of the founders, they decided to take action against the death of Instant Photography. Shooting Polaroid is like owning vinyl. In a world increasingly filled with the digital, there’s just no analog to analog.</p>

                    <h3>Every day Hipster items</h3>
                    <p>Hipsters have gotten a bad rap of late, but you can't deny they put together a mean ensemble. The hipster subculture is associated with indie and alternative music and genres such as folk, modern rock and chill. As part of the trend, those who abide by the hipster subculture flaunt a non-mainstream fashion sensibility, often sporting vintage, thrift, sustainable and eco-friendly pieces. </p>

                    <h3>Hipster way of life</h3>
                    <p>Hipsters are just people that are snobbier and more annoying about their taste in "alternative" things, which are all popular now thanks to the other hipsters. Hipsters pride themselves on liking things that no one else likes, and normally only really like them because they think no one else likes them and that theyre being unique. This is being delusional because all the other hipsters also like the same things.</p>
