there are 4:
-------------------+        These are just ways to organize your code
imprerative -- most basic programing (give machine instruction)

logical -- oposite of imperative. (you give your desired result. computer                                    does it)
functional -- (the most abstract of the 4 and views almost everything as                functions. Most complicated and takes the most time to                    understand )
object-orented -- (represent objects and they can be real world things)
