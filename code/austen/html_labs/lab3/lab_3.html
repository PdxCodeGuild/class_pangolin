                    <p> Example: This list wouldn’t be complete without mentioning the group of individuals who thought it was unacceptable for Polaroid to stop making instant film. Instead, they bought the production equipment from Polaroid, and within two years, concocted their own formulation, thus making the impossible, possible. In the words of the founders, they decided to take action against the death of Instant Photography. Shooting Polaroid is like owning vinyl. In a world increasingly filled with the digital, there’s just no analog to analog.</p>
