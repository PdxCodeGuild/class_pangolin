For Cabello running was the hope for a better world. Running was the bridge between old and new and and between where we are now with war and suffer and to the place of people work together as a tribe again. Many of his life philosophies were learned through personal hardship, when he found himself face to face with an old world tribe from mexico that lived everything he felt he left the modern American culture and moved to the copper canyons to spend more time contemplating life and running in close proximity to the Raramuri.<br/><img class = "2" src = "cabello_pic.jpg"  alt= "Cabello Blanco running" height = "150" width = "100"/><br/><a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_True>Click here to see Cabello Blanco's wiki</a></p>
        
        
        <pre ><q>I don't want anyone to do anything
except come run,party, dance, eat, and hang with us.
Running isn't about making people buy stuff.
Running should be free, man.</q>
