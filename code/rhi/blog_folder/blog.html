            <h3>About Elves</h3>
            <h4>The life and death cycle of Elves</h4>
            <p>Elves, like Men, are Children of Eru Il√∫vatar and thus are very similar to Men. Unlike Men, however, they are immortal, in that their bodies do not age once they have reached maturity, so that they do not seem to become elderly or die of old age. They can be killed by physical injury however, or they may come to death from wasting away if after long eons of life they lose the will to live. Some Elves in the First Age living near Angband died from a wasting disease, which was presumably issuing from Thangorodrim, Morgoth's fortress. The Elves came into existence before Men, and when Elves die they pass to the Halls of Mandos in Valinor. After a long period of waiting, the Elf (unless unwilling to return to life or judged a perpetrator of unforgivable crimes) will be reincarnated. 
                    For Elves, sex and marriage are one and the same, and it is that bodily union that achieves marriage. Elves lose interest in sex after they've had children. They do not consider the day a child was born as the moment they came into existence. Instead, they celebrate the day the child's parents begat them. Elves come of age at around fifty years old, and generally marry around this age. Elves who marry late or never are said to have strange fates. Elves can tell in the eyes and voice of another Elf whether they are married, and it is against an Elf's nature to take another by force; one so forced would reject bodily life and die. Because of the union of souls that occurs when Elves marry, and because of the eternal nature of Elven souls, they do not divorce or have multiple marriages. Elves have a taboo against incest, but marriage among second cousins is seen as acceptable.[19] Whether this results in degradation from strong bloodlines is unknown. 
                    Elves are (generally) unusually beautiful in face and body. There is little physical difference between males and females except that which is required for reproduction.[19] They have far better vision and hearing than Men. They also have skills and abilities beyond what is possible for Men, and many can craft seemingly magical objects. In The Silmarillion, it is mentioned that the Elves are indeed closest in kin to the Ainur, given that Elves possess ethereal grace and various powers. Elves are light of foot, can travel long distances without leaving tracks, and often can walk lightly across snow where the boots of Men would sink.[20] They do not require sleep, but are able to enter a waking meditative state to regain their strength which means they can be exhausted and tire.[21] Although the Elves are more resistant to adverse environments and lack of food than Men, they can succumb to them thus Elves do require sustenance.</p>

            <h4>Lament for Evenstar (and the little star)</h4>
            
            <pre>
                At starfade a time comes
                When you see one brilliant star left behind
                When the starry host has departed.
                The star fades, the world does not wait.
                
                Why do I linger and sing
                Under this fading/mortal light?
                
                There is a daisy among the elanor blossoms
                To me it is fair.
                There is a birch tree under the mallorn trees
                To me it is fair.
                There is a butterfly above the swan
                To me it is fair.
                A spark/small star follows Sirius
                To me it is fair.
                
                The leaves of the mallorn are numberless
                One tiny leaf, one fading leaf
                Holds my eyes. When will it fall?
                
                The brilliant star is fading
                Now it departs the heavens
                Now I will depart the world
                Holding a leaf in my hand
            </pre>
