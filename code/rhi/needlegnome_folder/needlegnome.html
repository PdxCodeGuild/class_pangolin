                    <p>Welcome to Needlegnome's Home webpage. We are currently under construction so some information may be missing or links may not work yet. We thank you for your patience while we create a website to best fulfill your quilting needs.  </p>
                    <p> We are a small family owned business run by Wife and Husband team. Needlegnome started from Mrs.Gnome's love of all thing fiber art with a focus on quilting. She has been peicing quilts on and off for the last 15 years and been tightly focused on it for the last three years (Please see our gallery to see some of the projects that Mrs. Gnome has cut her teeth on). She got tired of fighting the quilt thru a small domestic machine everytime she needed to complete a sandwhich, And the level of cursing that happened whenever she neede to make the quilt sandwhich was nearly legendary. One day Mr.Gnome suggested that Mrs.Gnome start looking at the possability of getting a long arm machine so she could beter get the results that she wanted on her projects. Needless to say she put up very little fuss over the suggestion and even added to her want list by suggesting a machine with a computerized option. The start of Needlegnome is the result of this converstion!</p>
