#Lab 15: Number to Phrase

# Convert a given number into its english representation. For example: 67 becomes 'sixty-seven'. Handle numbers from 0-99.
# Hint 2: use the digit as an index for a list of strings OR as a key for a dict of digit:phrase pairs.
# tens_digit = num // 10
# ones_digit = num % 10
