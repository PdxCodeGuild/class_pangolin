            </ul>
                
            <p>A singular talent who passed almost unnoticed during his brief lifetime, Nick Drake produced several albums of chilling beauty.

Ironically, Drake has achieved a far greater stature in the decades following his death, with an avid cult following that grows by the year. </p>
