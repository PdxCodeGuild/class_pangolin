            <blockquote>“Intelligence is one of the greatest human gifts. But all too often a search for knowledge
                drives out
                the search for love... Intelligence without the ability to give and receive affection leads to
                mental and
                moral breakdown, to neurosis, and possibly even psychosis.”<br><h4>--Daniel Keyes</h4></blockquote>
