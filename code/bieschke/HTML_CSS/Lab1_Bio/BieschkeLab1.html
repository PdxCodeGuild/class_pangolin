                <div id="intro">The Emperor of Mankind, also known as the Emprah or E-Money, is the
                    almost-but-not-entirely-figurehead ruler of the Imperium of Man in the Warhammer 40k universe.
                    He has been enthroned in a life-sustaining device known as the Golden Throne for the last ten
                    millenia
                    and is nigh-on unable to communicate or influence things directly, so day-to-day ruling is done
                    without (and too often in spite of) Him.
                    Conversely, He is the only sustaining hope for Humanity, as faith in Him is the only way humans can
                    counter the insidious whispers of Ruin, and the treacherous ways of the Xenos.
                    Additionally, Faster-than-Light-Travel is entirely dependent on Him."</div>
