            <p style="padding: 150 px;float: right"><font font="Didot">Giodo is the creator of the Python programming language. He attributes choosing the name "Python" to "being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus)'".
                Van Rossum was born and raised in the Netherlands, where he received a master's degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Amsterdam in 1982. 
                He has a brother, Just van Rossum, who is a type designer and programmer who designed the typeface used in the "Python Powered" logo. Guido lives in Belmont, California, with his wife, Kim Knapp, and their son. 
                According to his home page and Dutch naming conventions, the "van" in his name is capitalized when he is referred to by surname alone, but not when using his first and last name together</font></p>
