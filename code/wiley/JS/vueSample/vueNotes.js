/* ----- VUE ----
Vue is a MVVM framework.  (Model view, view model)
    Model <---> View Model <---> View
 (data/state) - (Vue Syncs) - (Template)

View model has a "shadow DOM"
-A shadow DOM is when VUE updates the view model, but doesn't re-render the template until it knows the fastest way to update. 

READ THE VIEW DOCS THEY ARE GOOD.
Vue uses components, as modular blocks of codes to apply when needed.
